						<p>I guess everyone starts by 'Halo, what's your name?'
							Tarien. My name is Tarien van der Merwe. I don't like my surname.
							It's too Afrikaans and even though I am Afrikaans, I'm not always
							crazy about my culture. I think they are too narrow minded, but I
							guess it has its good and bad points.</p>
							
						<p>I grew up in about ten different places. They were mostly
							small places and living in the city now makes me realize how much I
							didn't like the small town vibe.</p>
						<p>Designing or being creative is my talent, slowly becoming a
							passion as I explore what design is really all about. I would love
							to make a difference in so many people's lives in some unexpected
							and big way through my designs, someday soon.</p>
										
						<p>I sing. Singing is my passion and it motivates me to do the
							impossible. I always say that when I sing my soul vibrates and the
							satisfaction I get from that is too intense to just ignore. My one
							big dream is to travel around the world and sing, to be on the
							stage in front of thousands and even millions of people.</p>
							
						<p>I love my family and friends and will not tolerate unfairness
							toward them. I honestly think that somehow I got the best of the
							best, good, real, honest, friends and family who loves and support
							you to be the best you, you can be. No funny weird stuff.</p>

			<p>The following statement might sound strange but it's so true.
				I am a solid believer of, 'The power of life and death lies in the
				tongue.' Therefore I try to never tell a lie, I speak only the truth
				and if what I say is not true at that particular moment, it will be
				soon. If anyone ever finds me telling a lie, they should feel
				obligated to take me on about it.</p>
			<p>I am a fun person to be around, when I'm not angry. I don't
				get angry easily but when I do, apparently I'm a 'bitch', so my
				sister and best friend says (I didn't know that.. and I'm working on
				it - promise). I am not a very complicated person. I'm mostly just
				myself and feel very comfortable in my own skin; if you stick around
				long enough I'll even poop in front of you (hehe). It's been said
				that I can make the most awkward moments seem so normal.</p>
			<p>I don't care about the silly, unnecessary distractions in life
				such as money, possessions, people's issues and silly comments or
				even tantrums sometimes. I do care about having fun and being real,
				no fakeness.</p>
			<p>I am a strong and independent girl but also very well able to
				submit under authority and leadership above me. Some people just
				telling me what to do, and how to do it, on the other hand, brings
				out the very stubborn part of me. I usually feel very bad after
				doing something wrong, especially if I've unfairly offended someone.
				I always try to go and apologise, even if it's hard.</p>
			<p>Then probably the most important part of who I am is the fact
				that I've given my life completely to Jesus and I love Him with all
				my heart. He accepted me regardless of anything I did. He loves me
				unconditionally and nothing I or anyone else can ever do can change
				that. Every moment I spend with Him surpasses all the good things
				that have ever happened to me before, every time. And after a really
				bad day, the way He makes me feel when I go talk to Him about it, is
				so mind blowing that I will seriously take ten, even worse days, if
				I can just get that again. It is NOT a feeling, its real and I will
				love Him forever.</p>
